ex_contracts█<m>WHAT ARE CONTRACTS?</m> &%&%Try to <m>OFFER</m> as much as others or even less. You may not always win - even if you have the lowest price. &%&%<m>Hiring Office Employees</m> will allow you to offer more money. Do not negotiate for contracts which you cannot complete!

ex_payloads█<m>WHAT ARE PAYLOADS?</m> &%&%Pay big attention to payload's <m>DEADLINE</m>, <m>SIZE/ORBIT</m>, and <m>TYPE</m> of it.

ex_capsuleLaunch█<m>HOW TO LAUNCH CAPSULES?</m> &%&%Make sure you have a Capsule and a Rocket that can launch it.Check it by going into the <m>RESEARCH WINDOW</m>, then selecting a Rocket and checking if the <m>CAPSULE SUPPORT UPGRADE</m> is unlocked.&%&% Crew Capsules require <m>CREW CAPSULE SUPPORT</m>!

ex_spaceshipLaunch█<m>HOW TO LAUNCH SPACESHIPS?</m> &%&%Launching Spaceships works exact the same as launching Capsules! You just need a <m>SPACESHIP</m> and a <m>SUPERHEAVY ROCKET</m>.

ex_marsLaunch█<m>HOW TO LAUNCH TO MARS?</m> &%&%Make sure you have: &%-Spaceship (Crew or Cargo) &%-Tanker Spaceship (to refuel on orbit) &%-Superheavy Rocket &%-Some payloads you want to bring to Mars. &%&%Build the payloads in the <m>PRODUCTION WINDOW</m>. &%&%Once you have these, just launch the Spaceship like you would normally do, then select Mars payloads and a Tanker. &%Flight to Mars takes around 2-3 years. Spaceships will be waiting on the <m>PARKING ORBIT</m> before they leave.

ex_staticfire█<m>WHAT IS A STATIC FIRE?</m> &%&%It's a Test in which the Rocket fires its Engines for a few seconds without leaving. &%&%To test a particular Rocket, select it in the <m>VEHICLE WINDOW</m> and then click on the Static Fire button. &%&%It is not required but highly <m>RECOMMENDED</m>, as the rocket has a much better chance of succeeding in a mission.

ex_droneship█<m>WHAT ARE DRONESHIPS?</m> &%&%They are required if you want to Land with a Rocket that flies to <m>Geostationary Orbit (GEO)</m>, or if the Rocket fairing is <m>85% FULL</m>. &%&%You will be able to Buy, Name, and Move them around the world in the <m>VEHICLES WINDOW</m>.

ex_linklink█<m>WHAT IS LINKLINK?</m> &%&%It's a huge constellation of many thousands of small satellites in the <m>LOW EARTH'S ORBIT</m>. LinkLink will allow you to provide an internet connection in literally any place on the Earth. &%&%Build them in the <m>PRODUCTION WINDOW</m> and then send them with a Rocket just like a normal payload. &%Don't forget to <m>BUILD TERMINALS</m> on the ground!

ex_production█<m>PRODUCTION?</m> &%&%YES! You can Produce your <m>OWN</m> Payloads! &%Build a Giga factory first; then in the <m>PRODUCTION WINDOW</m>, you can choose what kind of Payload you want to Produce.

ex_mars█<m>MARS :o</m> &%&%Build an Infrastructure on Mars, then to transport the first people from Earth. (Once you have a lot of people on Mars you will start them doing s... <m>human-reproduction-thing</m>!) &%&%You can use <m>NUKES</m> to warm up the Mars and <m>TERRAFORM</m> it.
